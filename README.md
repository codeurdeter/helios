# Java Internship Technical Test - Helios

Hello, I'm André Rodrigues.

This repository is my technical test for a potential Java internship at Helios.

I decided to do the first exercice in Java because I don't yet know Kotlin well enough for a time-limited exercise like this. However, I do know the language because I used the libktx library for quite some time while trying to develop a video game and I would love to learn it more with you.

Thank you for considering my application and this exercise.
